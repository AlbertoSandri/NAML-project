# NAML-project
Project for NAML (Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning) course held at Polimi in 2022/2023.

The project consists in implementing a machine learning based credit card fraud detection based on a given paper.

We implement 5 different binary classifiers from scratch and evaluate the performance using the same metrics proposed in the reference paper.
The classifiers are:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Artificial Neural Network
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
